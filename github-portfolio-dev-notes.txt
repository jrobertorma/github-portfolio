## About create-react-app
I've been using create-react-app since my first steps with react. But never actually realized the things you need to run a react app when setting yourself the environment, such as configuring webpack and babel.

So in a few words, 'create-react-app' creates a basic setup like the one used in the 'MovieList App' but with only one comand.

Better written articles you can read about this: 
	- https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app
	- https://create-react-app.dev/

Install the tool with:
	
	npm install -g create-react-app

Create a new app with
	
	npx create-react-app my-app
	cd my-app
	npm start //or yarn start
