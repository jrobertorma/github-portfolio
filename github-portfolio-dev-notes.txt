## About create-react-app
I've been using create-react-app since my first steps with react. But never actually realized the things you need to run a react app when setting yourself the environment, such as configuring webpack and babel.

So in a few words, 'create-react-app' creates a basic setup like the one used in the 'MovieList App' but with only one comand.

Better written articles you can read about this: 
	- https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app
	- https://create-react-app.dev/

Install the tool with:
	
	npm install -g create-react-app

Create a new app with
	
	npx create-react-app my-app
	cd my-app
	npm start //or yarn start

## About progressive web apps (PWA)
A PWA is a web app that is a web app that can be used on both mobile and desktop devices.

"A PWA is usually faster and more reliable than regular web applications as it focuses on an offline/cache-first approach. This makes it possible for users to still open our application when they have no or a slow internet connection due to its focus on caching. Also, users can add our application to the home screen of their smartphone or tablet and open it like a native application."

You can create a PWA with a new create-react-app template with the command:
	
	npx create-react-app my-app --template cra-template-pwa
